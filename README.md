# Predict-Iranian-Stocks-Market

Implementation of stock price prediction model using deep learning specially using LSTM based on recurrent neural network

#### Introduction 
    The amount of financial exchange that happens every day in the financial markets is a very impressive figure that humans
    It encourages many people to work in this market, as we saw with the spread of the Corona virus
    And the collapse of many active businesses and the need to implement policies such as the national quarantine
    All over the world, including our country, people's desire to invest in these financial markets increased and the volume and
    Considerable daily transactions are carried out in these markets, therefore, the use of artificial intelligence and application
    The computational ability of computers was given special attention in order to obtain the best profit in these markets
    This project aims to implement a model to predict the price trend based on deep learning
    which is by means of Python programming language and using the Keras library and building a neural network
    A regression based on long short-term memory LSTM has been implemented.
    Therefore, the data provided in this program is related to the Iranian stock market, and an effort has been made to ensure the accuracy of the model
    Measure the implemented and finally show its diagram in each step.
